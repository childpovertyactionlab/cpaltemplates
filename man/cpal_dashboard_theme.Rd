\title{Create CPAL Dashboard Theme}
\usage{
cpal_dashboard_theme()
}
\value{
A `bs_theme` object with added CPAL metadata attributes:
\itemize{
  \item \code{cpal_variant}: Set to "dashboard".
  \item \code{cpal_version}: The version of the template (currently 1.0.0).
  \item \code{created}: Timestamp of theme initialization.
}
}
\description{
Initializes a Bootstrap 5 theme using `bslib` that automatically incorporates
brand settings from `_brand.yml`. It also attempts to load an additional
SCSS layer for custom CPAL-specific styling components.
}
\details{
This is the recommended function for new Shiny dashboards, replacing the
deprecated [cpal_shiny()] function.


The function first looks for the SCSS file in the package installation
(`inst/scss/cpal-theme.scss`), then falls back to local paths for development.
If no SCSS file is found, a warning is issued but the base Bootstrap theme
is still returned.

The theme uses BSlib's brand support (`brand = TRUE`) to automatically read
brand configuration from `_brand.yml` in the project root or package.
